    <p>I'm a Professor of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin –
  Madison. My PhD is in developmental psychology and my research focuses on how the way we think and move changes with age and experience.
  In my spare time I love to ride bikes, build wooden watercrafts, play soccer, and eat ice cream.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Research</h2>
    <p>
      The focus of my work is on change: how children think about changes in the world surrounding them and how children and adults adapt to changes in their local environment in order to act safely and effectively.

      <ol class="research-list">
      These two topics divide into three lines of research:

        <li> children’s causal reasoning and conceptual development</li>
        <li> motor development and control across the life span</li>
        <li> how cognitive and motor development interact</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="research-header">Children’s Reasoning and Conceptual Development</h3>
    <p>
      I have long been fascinated with how children reason about objects and events in the world and how they can differentiate between things that are possible in the real world with those that aren't.  This lead me to examine children’s understanding magic, fantasy, biological changes such as growth and metamorphosis, and children’s understanding of death.
    </p>
    <h3 class="research-header">Motor Development and Control</h3>
    <p>
      I have also been interested in how children come to control their bodies in space and how the control of movement is influenced by age and experience.  I have conducted research on how children and adults control their balance, how specific experiences such as learning T’ai Chi lead to improvements in the way older adults move, and how factors such as the equipment and fatigue influence firefighters' balance and walking.
    </p>
    <h3 class="research-header">Interaction of Cognitive and Motor Development</h3>
    <p>
      Another area of research that I focus on examines children’s action errors. Action errors are behaviors where young children (and sometimes adults!) attempt to perform an action on an object that cannot be successfully completed because the object is too small (scale error) the object is depicted in a photograph (grasping error) or the object is available on digital media (media errors).

      I've also researched the the development of children's drawing capabilities in relation to cognitive and motor development
